# PEMPal

# Description
This repository contains the PEMPal application framework template and builds on top of the StanfordBDHG Template Application.  

Our application is an IOS and IOS watch application meant to help people with long covid by alerting them to overexertion and provides exercise alternatives, decreasing the likelihood of exacerbating chronic fatigue through post-exertional malaise.  
Users with long COVID experience high symptom burden with no clear treatment options or pathophysiological explanations. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and chronic fatigue occur with a time-delay after strenuous physical activity. Users need a way to track their physical activity levels and modulate behavior to prevent PEM, given there’s no immediate feedback

This branch works with Xcode 14.1.0, Swift 5.7 and supports iOS 13 and above.
# Application Structure
The application uses the CardinalKit FHIR standard to provide a shared repository for data exchanged between different modules using the FHIR standard. You can learn more about the CardinalKit standards-based software architecture in the CardinalKit documentation.
# Build and Run the Application
